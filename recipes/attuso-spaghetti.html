<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p></p>This is perhaps one of my favorite recipes to make when it comes to connecting with my familial roots. My great grandmother would make this, which she learned from her Sicilian parents. Their original recipe was much different. It would encompass every left over meat remaining in the house. The sauce would be kept in the refrigerator, or on the stove at a low simmer, for days. By the end of the week, the spaghetti would contain everything from ground beef to chicken to even pork chops.</p>
<p>However, I add a little Cajun flare to it by using homemade meatballs with italian sausage, or andouille if that is what I have leftover. The meatball recipe comes from my grandfather on another side of the family. I learned to combine these two recipes from him. They go every well together and are served best with parmesian and perhaps some garlic bread.</p>
